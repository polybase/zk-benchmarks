# FAQ

## Who made this and why?

Hi, I'm [Calum](https://x.com/calummoore), CTO of [Polybase Labs](https://x.com/polybase_xyz) 👋

We made ZK-bench to help the ZK community to better understand the trade-offs and performance of different frameworks. It can be really hard to setup and run your own benchmarks for each of the growing numbers
of frameworks. Whilst the frameworks themselves often provide a set of benchmarks, it's often hard to make direct comparisons as there are many factors that can affect the performance of a benchmark. We've tried hard to 
create similar conditions for the benchmarks across all frameworks.

We're also the team behind [Polylang](https://polylang.dev), and we wanted to be able to understand the performance we're able to achieve in comparison to other frameworks.

## Which is the best framework?

There is no “best” framework. As you can see from the table above, there are a lot of caveats and trade offs. You should choose the framework that best meets your needs, which will depend on what kind of application you are building. If you have questions about which framework is best for you, feel free to reach out [on ~Twitter~ X @polybase_xyz](https://x.com/polybase_xyz).


## What is ZK?

ZK (Zero Knowledge) is a type of cryptography that allows a proof (a kind of certificate) to be generated that allows one party to prove to another that they know a value (or that some condition holds true), without revealing any information about the value itself. 

There are two main components to ZK:

1. **Zero Knowledge** - the ability to run computation without revealing all of the inputs, but having the output be trusted
2. **Provable computation** -  proves the code ran as designed, and therefore the output can be trusted

Here's a simple example to demonstrate the idea of provable computation. Below the code checks if the input provided is over 18. 
If we ran this in zero knowledge, we could generate a proof that the input value was > 18 without revealing the actual number:

```js
function isOver18(age: number): boolean {
  return age > 18;
}
```

## What’s the difference between a STARK and a SNARK?

These are two different approaches to provable zero knowledge computation.

## What are unbounded programs?

These are programs which have inputs or logic where the number of cycles or iterations is not known at compile time. For example, a program that iterates over a list of items and checks if each item is greater than 18. The number of items in the list is not known at compile time, so the program is unbounded.

In general, SNARKs require a program to be bounded at compile time, whereas STARKs do not.

### Unbounded Program

The following is an example of a program that is unbounded, as you can see the number of items in the list is not known at compile time as it is supplied as an argument when calling the program.

```
function sum(list: number[]): number {
  let total = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < list.length; i++) {
    total += list[i];
  }
  return total;
}
```

### Bounded Program

For frameworks that require a bounded program, you would have to explicitly define the number of items in the list, for example:

```
function sum(list: number[10]): number {
  let total = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < list.length; i++) {
    total += list[i];
  }
  return total;
}
```

### Bounded Programs with Recursive Proofs

It's possible to use ZK recursive proofs to break up a bounded program, to allow it to be effectively unbounded. This could be done either at the application level or the framework level. 

At the application level, the developer would break up their program at logical points. For example, imagine we're building a zk-chain, and we want to prove an unbounded number of transactions per block (i.e. some blocks have 10 txns, others 20, etc). Instead of proving all of the transactions in a single proof, we could generate each proof, merging it with the last proof until we've included all txns. In the end we'd have one proof, that could contain any number of txns.

At the framework level, the frontend language or IR (intermediate representation) could translate for loops and unbounded inputs into separate program proofs, and then merge them for the user. This would be easier for the user, although we're not aware of any framework that provides this functionality today.


## What is a ZK Recursive Proof?

A ZK recursive proof (often just called "recursion") is the ability to verify a proof, or many proofs, into another proof. There's nothing crazy going on here. Verification of proofs is simply a computation and ZK already enables proving of arbitrary computations.

Recursion has a lot of benefits, it allows us to:

  - Turn bounded programs into practically unbounded programs
  - Break up larger computations into multiple parts, useful for:
    - RAM constrained environments like the browser
    - Parallazing proofs across many different machines
  - Aggregating multiple proofs into a single proof (e.g. to minimize network bandwidth)


## How do you run the benchmarks?

We run the benchmarks using a [Github Action](https://github.com/polybase/zk-benchmarks/actions) using a self-hosted runner, 
running on a dedicated AWS instance. We use a dedicated instance to ensure that the performance calculations are not degraded 
by other users that might otherwise be using the shared instance.
Benchmarks are updated automatically whenever we update the benchmarks or the versions of the frameworks we are testing.

## What benchmark tool do you use?

We actually created our own 😅, which you can find here on [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/benchy). We tried using criterion which is pretty much the default for Rust, 
but it didn't really serve our needs for the kinds of tests we are running. Criterion is tailored for nanosecond-level performance measurements of quick, simple functions, but we needed something that worked well with longer running benchmarks (ZK is still quite slow in many cases). We were also able to automatically profile the memory requirements of each benchmark, which is something we couldn't do with criterion.


## Can you benchmark X or add framework Y?

Sure, just [submit a PR](https://github.com/polybase/zk-benchmarks) 😉
